# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/alexwoo-awso/skeleton/issues) to report bugs or suggest features.
- Check existing issues first to avoid duplicates.
- For bug reports, include: what you expected, what happened, and steps to reproduce.

### Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch from `main` (`git checkout -b my-change`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Test that the skeleton still works correctly when copied to a new project.
5. Commit with a clear message describing the change.
6. Push to your fork and open a Pull Request.

### What Makes a Good PR

- **Focused** -- One logical change per PR.
- **Documented** -- If you add a new file or change the structure, update `SETUP.md` and `README.md`.
- **Tested** -- Verify the skeleton bootstraps correctly after your changes.

### Areas for Contribution

- Improving template content in `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `TODO.md`, `DONE.md`, or `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`
- Adding useful default skills to `.skills/`
- Improving the `SETUP.md` onboarding guide
- Fixing typos and clarifying documentation
- Adding support for additional AI tools or platforms

> **Note:** `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are both self-contained instruction files. Changes to shared content (project structure, rules, documentation sections) should be reflected in both files.
