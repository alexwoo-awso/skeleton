## CRITICAL RULES (Read Before Every Change)

<!-- Add project-specific rules as you discover recurring bugs. -->
<!-- Rules should be concise, actionable, and prevent specific failure modes. -->
<!-- Number them sequentially. Reference LESSONS_LEARNED.md for details. -->

1. **Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS).** Avoid over-engineering. Only add what's requested or clearly necessary.

2. **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY).** Extract common patterns. Use shared functions/utilities instead of duplicating code.

> **See LESSONS_LEARNED.md for detailed patterns and examples.**
